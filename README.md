# **Studies, Happiness! Is there a correlation?**

## **Description:**

Ever wondered if a nation's educational prowess could influence its collective happiness? Our repository dives into this intriguing question, utilizing three distinct datasets sourced from Kaggle:

1. [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/)
2. [PISA Performance Scores by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/pisa-performance-scores-by-country)
3. [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

These diverse datasets paved the way for a comprehensive exploration. Leveraging a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, we seamlessly engineered the data for analysis. Our approach was hands-on; no third-party ETL tools were employed—just the raw power of Python scripting.

It's worth noting that this entire project unfolded in a mere day and a half. While the time constraint restricted cloud automation for data loading, we ensured a meticulous process on our local machines.

Post-ETL, we harnessed the visualization capabilities of Tableau Public, creating compelling visuals to decipher the relationship between education and happiness levels. The visuals not only answer our primary question but also offer a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay.

Notably, we delved into American students' performance in exams, scrutinizing the influence of their parents' education—an additional layer of insight into the broader narrative.
